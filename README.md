# nuxt3-todoApp
In my Nuxt3 application, I'll demonstrate how to fetch data from the server side to nuxt server and then display it on the client side. In comparison to vue, which allows us to use fetch requests and render data, nuxt does not.. In nuxt we have different methods on which we can communicate with nuxt-server and server.
